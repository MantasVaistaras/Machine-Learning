Implement logistic regression and applying it to the dataset.

The goal is to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university. We will determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their results on two exams. We have historical data from previous applicants that we can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, we have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions decision.

We are using complex calculations to optimize the cost function in order to find the boundary. Here is the result:

Now after learning the parameters, we can use the model to predict whether a particular student will be admitted.
